<!-- To start, build a homepage with 4 sample headlines and photos hard-coded into
the template and a nav bar on the top. For now, don't put any real links on the
nav bar. -->

<!-- Next, let users click on a headline or photo to view the full story. Keep the
navbar showing. -->

<!-- Now, on the Bustle homepage, notice that there is a "carousel" at the top, with
arrows on either side; when you click an arrow, a new story moves to the center
of the screen. Add this feature. Don't worry about the scrolling effect. -->

<!-- When a user hovers their mouse over the social buttons in the upper right
corner of the Bustle homepage, a little menu appears. Implement this same
functionality, but only when a user clicks on the icons. (If you'd like to try
to get it working with hover, you'll need to do something like
{{action "toggleSocialIcons" on="mouseEnter"}}.) -->
